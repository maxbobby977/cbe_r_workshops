```

## Task 1: Setup

Install and load the `janitor` R package. This package contains useful functions like `clean_names()` that help you tidy up messy data quickly. Then, read in the `vaccine_data.csv` file and run `clean_names()` on the dataset.

## Task 2: Mathematical Operations

Answer the following math questions (with the help of R):

1. 45 plus 73 (using the plus sign)
2. 892 divided by 4 (using the forward slash sign)
3. 16 times 5 (using the asterisk sign)
4. The square root of 92 (hint... use Google!)
5. The natural log of 103 (hint... use Google!)

## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Find the total number of people vaccinated in the U.S. as of February 1st, 2021.

2. Which state had the highest number of daily vaccinations as of February 10th, 2021?

3. How many states had a share of doses used of more than 0.5 on January 19th, 2021?
