## Intro to R and RMarkdown

This is what a code chunk is:

```{r}
print("hello world! :)")
```

The code within the chunk, which is demarcated by three tick symbols (`), will be executed. You can add tinker with different options in the **chunk header**, which is enclosed by the two brackets (\{\}). One useful chunk option is *echo = FALSE*, which suppresses the code from showing and only produces an output.

For example, if we add *echo = FALSE* to the above code chunk, we only get the printed output.

```{r echo=FALSE}
print("hello world! :)")
```

You can "knit" an RMarkdown by clicking the yarn icon, or by using the keyboard shortcut (there are a lot of these in RStudio): CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + K. This creates a prettier HTML output.

You can save a document by going to File-> Save or with the shortcut CTRL/CMD + S.

```{r}
print("Hello world")

# The above is a line of code. This is a comment.
```

You can create comments, or sections of text that will not be executed as code, by adding a '#' in front of the section.

## Loading packages and importing data

Different packages in R do different things. There's a package that helps you plot pretty things called **ggplot**, a package that contains a bunch of useful functions for data transformation and analysis called **dplyr**, and even a fortune teller package. We'll be installing the first two with the following lines of code:

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Once you've installed them, you need to *load* them before use. Every time you restart R, it forgets about your previous session. You can load packages like so:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

We will be working with a publicly available dataset from the CDC called "COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data".

Once you have it downloaded, make sure it is in the same folder as the RMarkdown document you have with code. You can read in a CSV file like so:

```{r}

```

## Exploratory analysis & descriptive stats

Summary
View
glimpse
variable types
NA values





## Data transformation with dplyr

filter
select
mutate
arrange
summarise



## Plotting with ggplot

geom_bar
geom_hist
geom_point
scatter
boxplot
facet_wrap
titles / labels
themes


scale_coord_flip
geom_hline

## Other R applications

You can do so much more with R, including but not limited to mapping / GIS stuff!!! And making a website! And election predictions, and COVID dashboards (link it), and ML
