## Intro to R and RMarkdown

This is what a code chunk is:

```{r}
print("hello world! :)")
```

The code within the chunk, which is demarcated by three tick symbols (`), will be executed. You can add tinker with different options in the **chunk header**, which is enclosed by the two brackets (\{\}). One useful chunk option is *echo = FALSE*, which suppresses the code from showing and only produces an output.

For example, if we add *echo = FALSE* to the above code chunk, we only get the printed output.

```{r echo=FALSE}
print("hello world! :)")
```

You can "knit" an RMarkdown by clicking the yarn icon, or by using the keyboard shortcut (there are a lot of these in RStudio): CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + K. This creates a prettier HTML output.

You can save a document by going to File-> Save or with the shortcut CTRL/CMD + S.

```{r}
print("Hello world")

# The above is a line of code. This is a comment.
```

You can create comments, or sections of text that will not be executed as code, by adding a '#' in front of the section.

## Loading libraries and importing data

Different libraries in R do different things. There's a library that helps you  



## Exploratory analysis & descriptive stats

Summary
View
glimpse
variable types
NA values





## Data transformation with dplyr

filter
select
mutate
arrange
summarise



## Plotting with ggplot

geom_bar
geom_hist
geom_point
scatter
boxplot
facet_wrap
titles / labels
themes


scale_coord_flip
geom_hline

## Other R applications

You can do so much more with R, including but not limited to mapping / GIS stuff!!! And making a website! And election predictions, and COVID dashboards (link it), and ML
